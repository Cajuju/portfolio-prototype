                <p class="descript-Content">My position in for this company is game designer and programmer. As game designer, My role is to plan and create a concept for each game. The first game that I created for this company is a bridge building game, which is titled "Age of Bridges". The goal of the game is to build a strong enough bridge that allows the NPCs to cross safely.</p>

                <h1 class="titleContent"><a href ="http://nhiproject.org/">Namibia Action Team 2016</a></h1>
                <p class="descript-Content">From May 8, 2016 - June 1, 2016, I flew to Namibia along with nine other Computer Science majors. During my time in Namibia, I worked with NUST (Namibia University of Science and Technology) students and professors to create an application and to set a foundation for a health informatics system. The situation in Namiba is that most of public and private hospitals only use paper records, because they do not have an electronic system. Since they mostly have paper records, hospitals would lose patient records or make duplicate records. My team and I along with the NUST students created a prototype of the application that we presented to various doctors and influential people of Namibia. My team was able to impress every single person and gained their full support for the project. Even though most of my time in Namibia was spent on the focus of the project, my team and I were able to create friendships and experience the culture of Namibia. My team and I left Namibia with the feeling of accomplishment, and the feeling that our work was not yet finished. We created a solid and strong foundation for the project, and we also created friendships with many Namibians there.
