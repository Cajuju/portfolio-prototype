                            <p>I am a 4th year student from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reseda,_Los_Angeles">Reseda</a>, California studying <a href="http://www.apu.edu/clas/computerscience/cs/">Computer Science</a> at <a href="http://www.apu.edu/">Azusa Pacific University</a>.</p>

                            <br>

                            <p>My main interest in Compuer Science is Web Development. I enjoy Web Development for many reasons. One of those reasons is that I enjoy the satisfaction of building the website. As I built this personal website, I enjoy the feeling of the progress that I have made. I am very willing to put the extra time and effort to become more knowledgeable in this field. When I started my studies as a Computer Science major, I had barely any knowledge of Computer Science. The first language I learned was Java, which is the languaged that was used in most of my Computer Science classes. Since I developed an interest in Web Development, I have devoted most of my spare time researching and learing languages and applications that will benefit my employers and I in the future.

                            <p class="lastParagraph">Volunteer work is something that I have been doing to get experince in different fields of Computer Science. I have been working with a professor at APU(Azusa Pacific University) to create games that are designed for children from elementary and below. The company the is called <a href="https://creativeplayonline.com/main/">Creative Play</a>, and it is still in the developing stages. Another volunteer opportunity that I was able to be involved in was a month long trip to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namibia">Namibia</a>. The trip was from May 8, 2016 - June 1, 2016. This was an action team composed of 10 Computer Science majors, including myself. The action team's purpose was to assist NUST (<a href="http://www.nust.na/">Namibia University of Science and Technolog</a>y) students and professor in the creation of a health informatics system for public and private hospitals to use.</p>
